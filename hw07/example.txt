 I was born in Hong Kong.  Any Hong Kong people?  A couple of us?  Awesome, man.

For you guys that haven't been following the news,  Hong Kong is a part of

Japan.  I'm joking, obviously.  But I said the same shit in Kansas City,  and

people were like, really?  We learned something new today, Bill.  I did a show

in Kansas City, I don't know why either.  People are very nice in Kansas City.
